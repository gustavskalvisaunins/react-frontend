# Simple React newsletter subscription page
Newsletter subscription page for an imaginary company 'pineapple'. The layout is responsive, contains many hover effects, and input fields are validating for: 
* Empty e-mail field
* Incorrectly filled e-mail field
* E-mails that are ending with '.co'
* Agreement to terms of service

After submitting a correctly filled form, page turns to a 'success' layout.
